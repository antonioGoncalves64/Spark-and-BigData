    "\n",
    "When a program runs on multiple cores with access to the same physical memory, it can use a shared memory design. In shared memory programming, the computation occurs within a single multithreaded process, and each thread within the process has access to memory in the same virtual address space. Communication among threads is efficient because any changes to shared memory are immediately visible to all other threads in that process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, when a program uses multiple processes, such that computational tasks do not share memory, its processes cannot communicate by writing updated values directly to memory. This situation requires a distributed memory design. In distributed memory programming, each process owns part of the data, and other processes must send a message to the owner in order to update that part of the data. The communication could be between processes running on the same node, or between processes running on different nodes in a cluster, but the underlying communication model is the same. Interface standards like Message-Passing Interface (MPI) facilitate distributed memory programming for cluster systems.\n",
