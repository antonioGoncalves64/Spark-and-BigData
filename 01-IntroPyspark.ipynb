In Python, an anonymous function is created with the lambda keyword. More loosely, it may or not be assigned a name. \nLambda functions can have any number of arguments but only one expression. The expression is evaluated and returned. Lambda functions can be used wherever function objects are required.\n\n**Syntax: lambda arguments: expression**\n\n1. This function can have any number of arguments but only one expression, which is evaluated and returned.\n1. One is free to use lambda functions wherever function objects are required.\n1.
